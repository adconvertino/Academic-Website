  Currently, I am a psychology resident in the [West Virginia University/Charleston Area Medical Center Doctoral Internship Training Program](https://medicine.hsc.wvu.edu/charleston/departments/behavioral-medicine-psychiatry/clinical-psychology-internship/). I am primarily seeing patients with disordered eating and emotion regulation difficulties.
  
  I am also a 6th year doctoral candidate at the [San Diego State University/University of Calfornia San Diego Joint Doctoral Program in Clinical Psychology](https://clinpsyc.sdsu.edu/) advised by [Dr. Aaron Blashill](https://bishlab.sdsu.edu/). I defended my dissertation in May 2023, focused on on the overlap of chronic stress, traumatic events, posttraumatic stress symptoms, and eating pathology.
