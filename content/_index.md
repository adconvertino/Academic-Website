description: I am a clinical psychologist and assistant professor at CSU Dominguez Hills. My research largely focuses on the role of stress – defined broadly to include both traumatic stressors and everyday stress – in eating disorders and other body image-related disorders (e.g., body dysmorphic disorder, muscle dysmorphia). Part of my research focuses on the exploration of eating disorders in sexual minority (e.g., gay, lesbian, bisexual) individuals and another line of research that I am currently pursuing is focused on how traumatic stressors and posttraumatic stress disorder are associated with eating disorders.
